My proposal for the final project is to create a pomodoro timer for individuals with ASD. A lot of times there are exectuive function difficulties associated with individuals with ASD and a timer specifically geared toward their own style of productivity and motivation would be beneficial. It will change to a 20 minute work, 10 minute break format as the 5 minutes can sometimes not be enough to fully counter the brain fog and mental fatigue that can sometimes occur for everyone but expecially those with exectuive function issues. I will incorporate sounds and various other sensory content to help those with ASD to not get as burnt out as quickly. There will be separate color modes for what the specific individual may desire.
