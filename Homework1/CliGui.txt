A Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) are different ways to interact with 
your computer. Both interfaces have their strengths and weakness. CLI is a more efficient and powerful 
way to interact with your computer but it sacrifices some usability and has a steep learning curve. GUI 
is more intuitive and user friendly but sacrifices by using far more system resources. CLI is an interface 
that uses text commands to control your computer. This a very efficient way to interact with your computer, 
but it requires the user to memorize or find the exact text commands. This requires quite a bit of effort 
most people do not have time for or effort to find them that just makes the process tedious. GUI, on the 
other hand, is easy to pick up for even new users of the platform. It presents the information through 
interactable windows, icons, Menus, and other visual options for interaction. This visual interface has 
some drawbacks such as the previously mentioned higher resource use but also they can offer less flexibility 
when working with the computer system. The viability of both systems has caused many computer manufacturers 
to have both interfaces available in their system.
