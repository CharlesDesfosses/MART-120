What had the greatest effect on me in the presentation from Pausch was his ability to remain positive
and maintain a purpose while facing the uncertain future of a terminal illness. The idea of transforming
obstacles into brick walls was a very powerful idea and an excellent way to reframe them. The idea of the
"Head Fakes" was also interesting. The concept of teaching a life lesson through indirect means is
enlightening for me. As someone who works in mental health facilitation I am always looking for new ways
to convey the same message or the same therapeutic techniques. I will look to implement this idea into the 
lessons I provide for the mental health day treatment group I facilitate. I have tried similar techniques
in the past but nothing to the extent he mentioned. I like the idea of using video games to teach coding. 
I also loved his emphasis of enabling other's dreams. The idea that helping others achieve their goals as a 
means for your own well being echoes the findings from Positive psychology studies. The fastest way to be
happy is to try and make someone else happy, at least the studies seem to show this. The way he approached
feedback and growth, demonstrated through the Building Virtual Worlds course, is also very inspiring and 
offers amazing insight into my own personal ventures into other people's wellbeing.
