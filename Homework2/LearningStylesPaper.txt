The question of whether learning styles affect how we learn would have to yes in my opinion. Are they
overblown as to the role they play in individuals learning, also a yes in my opinion. I do not believe that 
we all ahve specific learning styles but I do think that there are ways in which certain information certain
be presented that would make it easier for certain individuals to learn.  To put it sompler, there are
certain topics that tend to be more easily digested by those learning if taught through a specific medium.
The whole idea of learning as presented in the VARK model is simplified and has all of the nuance taken away.
I believe the model may also be ableist from the perspective of some neurodivergent people. I have ASD myself 
and the rigid categories that it tries to force cognitive processes into does not seem to speak for people 
who have different ways of processing information. I am glad the mental health practice is moving away from
these generalized ideas of what individuals are like and are beginning to treat individuals based oin their
individual needs.
